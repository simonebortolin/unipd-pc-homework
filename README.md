# Parallel Computing: parallelized Floyd-Warshall algorithm

This repository contains the homeworks to be developed in the Parallel Computing @ unipd course.

Parallel Computing is a course of the

- [Master Degree in Computer Engineering of the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua, Italy](https://www.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/IN/IN2547/003PD/INQ0091598/N0).

The idea of this project is to parallelise the Floyd-Warshall algorithm through a paralellisation with concentric squares.

# Organisation of the repository
The repository is organised as follows:

- `homework`: this folder contains the source code of the developed system.
- `report`: this folder contains the report describing the techniques applied and insights gained.
